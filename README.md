**Airbnb Price Category Prediction: Multi-Objective Modeling**

Welcome to the Airbnb Price Category Prediction project, where data science meets user-friendly listing pricing recommendations for aspiring hosts in Montreal. Our goal is to optimize the user experience by predicting listing price categories and providing valuable pricing ranges.

**Project Overview:**

Aspiring hosts often struggle to determine the right listing price on Airbnb. In this project, we use machine learning to predict price categories and suggest pricing ranges, making it easier for new hosts to enter the market.

**Key Tasks:**

1. **Understanding the Template**: Provide comprehensive comments on each code line, showcasing your grasp of the template. Describe the experimental protocol, hyper-parameter tuning, search space, and criteria for evaluating hyper-parameters.

2. **Problem Formulation**: Define the input, output, required data mining function, challenges, impact, and the desired ideal solution.

3. **Model Tuning and Documentation**: Employ the data science life-cycle to enhance model performance. Experiment with features, hyperparameters, and models. Document reasons, expectations, outcomes, and insights from each trial.

4. **Diverse Trials**: Conduct at least 6 trials with varied approaches, covering text inputs (GRU/LSTM, BiDirectional), image inputs (Conv2d, Dropout), multi-modality, and multi-objective learning.

**Answer the Questions:**

- Sequential Data and Fully-Connected Models: Discuss the suitability of fully-connected models for sequential and image data.

- GRU/LSTM and Gradient Issues: Explain gradient vanishing, gradient explosion, and how GRU/LSTM mitigate these challenges.

- Multi-Objective and Multi-Modality Learning: Define multi-objective/multi-task and multi-modality learning and elaborate on their application in this assignment.

- XGBoost, LightGBM, and CatBoost: Highlight the differences among XGBoost, LightGBM, and CatBoost.
